## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Pushing to Your GitHub Repository

If you've cloned this project and want to push it to your own GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/ShabdVasudeva/Math-Mate.git`), follow these steps after cloning and navigating into the project directory:

1.  **Initialize a new Git repository (if you haven't already cloned or if you removed the .git folder):**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

2.  **Add all files to staging:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

3.  **Commit your changes:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4.  **Rename the default branch to `main` (if it's not already named `main`):**
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    ```

5.  **Add your remote repository:**
    Replace `https://github.com/ShabdVasudeva/Math-Mate.git` with your actual repository URL.
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://github.com/ShabdVasudeva/Math-Mate.git
    ```
    If you already have a remote named `origin`, you might need to remove it first (`git remote remove origin`) or update its URL (`git remote set-url origin https://github.com/ShabdVasudeva/Math-Mate.git`).

6.  **Push your code to the remote repository:**
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```
